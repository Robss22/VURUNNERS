This java is created by Musanje Robert.
Initialization: Two arrays, names and times, store the runners' names and their corresponding times.
Loop: We loop through the times array to determine the fastest and second fastest times.
If the current time is faster than fastestTime, we update secondFastestTime and secondFastestRunner with the current fastestTime and fastestRunner, then update fastestTime and fastestRunner with the current values.
If the current time is only faster than secondFastestTime but not fastestTime, we update the second-fastest variables accordingly.
Output: The names and times of the fastest and second fastest runners are printed.
